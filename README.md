Second homework for the tirth module at DigitalTargovishte JAVA course.

The goal of the home work is to create:

1: a page at /numbers that shows all numbers between 1 and N
2. a page at /sum-numbers that displays the sum of all numbers between 1 and N
3. a page at /words that taks a Strign and an Int as a parameter and displays the word N times

using JAVA with Springboot and thymeleaf. 
As an extension to the homework I have contanerized it and published the image at: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ytrufchev/homeworktwo/general
